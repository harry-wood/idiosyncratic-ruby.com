Ruby has a built-in feature that is much like [Literate CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/#literate). In contrast to it, this Ruby option will not ignore literature, but garbage:

ARTICLE

## `-x[directory]`

    Tells Ruby that the script is embedded in a message.
    Leading garbage will be discarded until the  first line
    that starts with “#!” and contains the string, “ruby”.
    Any meaningful switches on that line will be applied.
    The end of the script must be specified with either EOF,
    ^D (control-D), ^Z (control-Z), or the reserved word
    __END__.  If the directory name is specified, Ruby will
    switch to that directory before executing script.

Awesome!
